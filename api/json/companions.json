He faced the Great Intelligence – once in Tibet and again in the London Underground – and twice fought the Martian Ice Warriors. What he lacked in intelligence, he more than made up for in strength, charm and instinct.

Following the Third Doctor’s regeneration, she travelled on with the Fourth, visiting the genesis of the Daleks, a planet made of solid gold, and blowing up a rocket designed to release an ancient evil god from his prison on Mars. After being possessed by Eldrad, she told the Doctor that she was “sick of being shot at, savaged by bug-eyed monsters”. As a result of this and a summons form Gallifrey, the Doctor dropped her back on Earth – although not in South Croydon as she wanted. After bumping into the Tenth Doctor at Deffry Vale School and helping defeat the Krillitanes, Sarah began investigating alien incursions from her home on Bannerman Road. Building a family around her, with her adopted son Luke and his friends, she took on Sontarans, Androvax and the Trickster. Never forgotten by the Doctor, her story goes on forever.",

Fortunately, the Doctor saved her from marrying Lance – who’d made a deal with the Empress of the Racnoss. Despite turning down the Doctor’s offer to travel with him, she began investigating possible alien incursions, in the hope she’d meet him again. When they were reunited at Adipose Industries, she took up the offer to travel in the TARDIS - visiting Pompeii, meeting Agatha Christie and helping thwart the Sontarans. When the Doctor was exterminated by a Dalek and began regenerating he funneled the energy into his spare hand. When Donna touched this, it provoked a ‘metacrisis’, where she acquired all of the Doctor’s knowledge. Although this was essential in stopping Davros, it started to destroy Donna’s body. The Doctor was forced to wipe her mind and return her to Sylvia and Wilf. He later bought Donna and new husband Shaun a winning lottery ticket.",

                "text": "Seven-year old Amelia Pond is visited one night by a mad man in box who eats fish fingers and custard, and who examines the frightening crack in her wall. She waits for him to return. For twelve years. When the “raggedy man” came back, Amy embarked on series of adventures with him, on the eve of her wedding to Rory Williams. The couple later travelled together, got married – an event the Doctor attended only after Amy remembered him back into existence – and had a daughter, Melody. In Amy’s own words, she went to sea and fought pirates, fell in love with a man who waited 2000 years to keep her safe, gave hope to Vincent van Gogh, and saved a whale in outer space. Touched by a Weeping Angel, Amy was catapulted back to 1938, where she lived a happy life with Rory and adopted a son.",

When the Doctor turned out to be real, there was initially some friction, but the two became good friends. Rory had a turbulent time in the TARDIS. He was killed by the Silurians and absorbed into a crack in time, before being resurrected as an Auton, who then killed Amy. After breaking his programming, he stood watch over her tomb in the Pandorica for 2000 years. When reality was restored, Rory ceased to be an Auton and returned to human form. While aboard the TARDIS, he and Amy became parents to Melody. Sent back in time to 1938 by a Weeping Angel, Rory lived a happy life with Amy. Their adopted son, Anthony Brian Williams, visited Rory’s father Brian in 2012, bringing a heart-breaking goodbye note from Rory.",
